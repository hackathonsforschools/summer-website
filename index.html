                <h2>What is the summer event?</h2>
                <div class="answer-box">
                    <p>
                        This event is a week-long, online programme designed for
                        students with a strong interest in technology. We will
                        provide a series of workshops and interactive sessions for
                        the students to build their technical and soft skills to
                        prepare them for the workplace. Over the course of the
                        program, the students will complete a guided group project
                        with an industry professional. For the group project,
                        students will be given a brief that's very broad so they
                        can be as creative as they like.

                <h2>What are our aims?</h2>
                <div class="answer-box">
                    <p>
                        We know how hard it is to stay at home during this
                        difficult time, with many students missing out on both
                        academic and extra-curricular opportunities. At Hackathons
                        for Schools we wish to continue to provide students with
                        the skills they need to excel in the technology industry,
                        wherever they are. We hope that providing sixth form
                        students with this unique online experience will give them
                        the opportunity to develop their technical skills, learn
                        how to work in teams remotely, and build their network by
                        engaging with industry professionals.

                        <br>

                        We’re targeting this program at sixth form students who are
                        considering the next stages in their career; whether that’s
                        further education, apprenticeships or their first jobs; and
                        are interested in learning more about working in
                        technology. Students can think of this program as a
                        replacement for the common Year 12 work experience week,
                        albeit an online and more academic alternative. Throughout
                        the various sessions we provide, students will gain an
                        insight into studying Computer Science at university and
                        will be able to ask questions to current students.
