- title: What is the Student Summer Sprint?
  answer: >-
    This event is a week-long, online programme designed for
    students with a strong interest in technology. We will
    provide a series of workshops and interactive sessions for
    the students to build their technical and soft skills to
    prepare them for the workplace. Over the course of the
    program, the students will complete a guided group project
    with an industry professional. For the group project,
    students will be given a brief that's very broad so they
    can be as creative as they like.

- title: What are our aims?
  answer: >-
    We know how hard it is to stay at home during this
    difficult time, with many students missing out on both
    academic and extra-curricular opportunities. At Hackathons
    for Schools we wish to continue to provide students with
    the skills they need to excel in the technology industry,
    wherever they are. We hope that providing sixth form
    students with this unique online experience will give them
    the opportunity to develop their technical skills, learn
    how to work in teams remotely, and build their network by
    engaging with industry professionals.

- title: Who can get involved?
  answer: >-
    We’re targeting this program at sixth form students who are
    considering the next stages in their career; whether that’s
    further education, apprenticeships or their first jobs; and
    are interested in learning more about working in
    technology. Students can think of this program as a
    replacement for the common Year 12 work experience week,
    albeit an online and more academic alternative. Throughout
    the various sessions we provide, students will gain an
    insight into studying Computer Science at university and
    will be able to ask questions to current students.
