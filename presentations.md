# Top tips for presentations

Presentations can be scary, but we've written our top tips for making an awesome demo!

## 1. Show off your project!

We want to see your project working! Don't worry if it doesn't quite work properly, or if it has bugs. This is an opportunity for you to show off what you've been working on throughout the week, and for others to learn from your experience.

We don't want to see slides, but instead how your project works. You'll just need to screen share the project so everyone can see on Zoom. If it's a website, just walk us through what it does, and why you might use it. If it's a terminal application, run us through that. If you're unsure, feel free to reach out to the `@h4s-team` on Slack!

## 2. Practice it!

Come up with an order so each person in your team knows what part they're going to talk about. This helps make the most of the 3 minutes and gives everyone a chance to talk about something. Each person could talk about the part they worked on!

## 3. Talk about how your project meets the judging criteria

Our judges will be rating your projects on our judging criteria, which can be found [here](https://h4s-student-summer-sprint.devpost.com). Make sure that you talk about each of the points as this makes it much easier for our judges to understand your projects.
